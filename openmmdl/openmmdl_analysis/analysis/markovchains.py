class MarkovChainAnalysis:
    """
    Class for analyzing binding mode transitions using Markov chains.

    This class provides functionality to analyze the transitions of binding modes over time in MD simulations.
    It allows the generation of Markov chain plots based on transition probabilities between the binding modes
    and highlights key binding modes based on their occurency in the trajectory.

    Attributes
    ----------
    min_transition : float
        Minimum transition percentage threshold for transitions in the graph.
    min_transitions : list
        List of transition thresholds [x1, x2, x5, x10] derived from min_transition.

        """
        Generates Markov chain graphs showing binding mode transitions across a simulation trajectory.

        Nodes represent binding modes, with size proportional to their frequency. Node colors reflect their dominant
        occurrence in one-third of the trajectory. Arrows represent transitions. Dual direction arrows show reversible behavior.

        For each transition threshold in `min_transitions`, a separate plot is generated and saved.

        Parameters
        ----------
        total_frames : int
            The number of frames in the protein-ligand MD simulation.
        combined_dict : dict
            A dictionary with the information of the Binding Modes and their order of appearance during the simulation for all frames.
        fig_type : str, optional
            File type for the output figures. Default is 'png'.
        font_size : int, optional
            The font size for the node labels. The default value is set to 36.
        size_node : int, optional
            The size of the nodes in the Markov Chain plot. The default value is set to 200.

        Returns
        -------
        None
            Saves one plot per transition threshold in the directory `Binding_Modes_Markov_States`.
